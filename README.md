# Festival Speech Synthesis System for Windows

This project contains code and Visual Studio solution files that enable the Festival Speech Synthesis System to be in Windows and accessible via COM (and thus .NET) 

N.B. this project does not add MSAPI capabilities to Festival. There is a repository at https://github.com/techiaith/Festival_MSAPI that could be worked or drawn upon to fullfill that aim.
