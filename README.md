# Festival Speech Synthesis System for Windows

This project contains code and Visual Studio solution files that enable the Festival Speech Synthesis System (http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/) to be in Windows and accessible via COM (and thus .NET) 

N.B. this project does not add MSAPI capabilities to Festival. There is a repository at https://github.com/techiaith/Festival_MSAPI that could be worked or drawn upon to fullfill that aim.

__N.B.__ this repository must be cloned into C:\festival so that all builds and functionality works as expected. 

__N.B.__ you must run Visual Studio as Administrator for the COM registatrion to work.
